## Overview

This is a solution to the [Javascript Counter Design] available via (https://jsbeginners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/counter-javascript-project.png). 

### The challenge

The challenge is like a basic introduction to the Javascript language, which is one of the basic languages any website designer (Frontend) needs to know. This is in continuation of the internship training program that is organised by the Side Hustle Team for us the interns under the front end track.

## My process

- First I made the semantic HTML5 markup using VS Code editor (for windows),
- I then added the Javascript code, ensuring that it does its proper functions, 
- I then added offline Fontawsome pack to where neccessary,
- Next I applied CSS styling from start to bottom of the page with appropriate selectors and properties,
- Then I added some media queries to make it a bit responsive accross various screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Javascript 
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Going through this challenge, though the task looks easy but it's not that easy, 
- I learnt a couple of things to which making mini research is one of them.
- Making researches became my second me in trying to accomplish this task,
- I came to understand a little bit of javascript. 
- This challenge realy exposed me to the javascript world and how by just tweaking some lines of codes can make the entire Web page perform wonders. 

## Javascript
### + - * / < > = 

Those comom maths operators came in handy when trying to accomplish this task as it enabled me apply the very function I needed my code to do. 

### Continued development

At this stage I will have to put more effort in learning more about using various javascript syntaxes as well as its control flows or structures. 

### Useful resources

- (https://www.google.com) - For making useful research
- (https://app.netlify.com) - This also helped me to host my challenge/project on the internet for FREE.
