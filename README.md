## Overview

This is a solution to the [Fylo dark theme landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

The challenge is to teach the internship students at Side Hustle about what CSS can do to a Web page and also, to test the coding level (HTML & CSS) of all the Side Hustle interns under the Frontend track.

## My process

- First I made the semantic HTML5 markup using VS Code editor (for windows),
- I then added offline Fontawsome pack to where neccessary,
- Next I applied CSS styling from start to bottom of the page with appropriate selectors and properties,
- Then I added some media queries to make it a bit responsive accross various screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Going through this challenge, though the task is not an easy one, 
- I learnt a couple of things to which making mini research is one of them.
- Making researches became my second me in trying to accomplish this task,
- although given the time frame I have. But by taking up this challenge, 
- I came to understand CSS and how it works with HTML and browsers proper. 
- This challenge realy exposed me to the various frontend design techniques used 
- to make pages responsive accross numerous screens and also how to add numerous effects 
- to any HTMl or Web content using CSS like colors, hover effects, styling links and the page background.

## HTML 
**<ul>Un-ordered list</ul>**

The code above came in handy when trying to append most of the sections outlined in the challenge and this made me to understand it very well, as well as the uses.

## CSS
**@media and (max/min-width: value)**

The code above also made me to understand that some of the responsiveness of most webpages can be twerked by just using this line of code.

### Continued development

At this stage I will have to put more effort in learning about CSS Flexbox in its entirerity. Making web pages to be responsive can be tedious sometimes and without prior or solid knowledge about CSS Flexbox or Flexibility, achieving page responsiveness will be difficult per say.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.github.com) - This helped me to upload my codes and also make it available for people to read and probably make references to.
- (https://app.netlify.com) - This also helped me to host my challenge/project on the internet for FREE.
